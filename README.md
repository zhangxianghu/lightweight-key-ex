This is a simulation of the cut-and-choose based lightweight key exchange protocol based on paper 

Paper: [Toward a Resilient Key Exchange Protocol for IoT](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3508398.3511520)

The protocol was tested on three devices (Raspberry Pi Zero W, Arduino Due, and SAM D21 Xplained) against three PKC-based algorithms: ECDH, DH, and RSA. 

In this simulation, we have n = 6, t = 4, and s = 28. # lightweight-key-ex
